# Getting Started with FlightData React App


## Fetures & UI/	UX Flow of Application
1.Home page: Navigate to Airports, Flights,Bookings and Ticketing information

2. Search Flight: Search for Flights,Bookings, Tickets and Airports. 

3. Date selection: Very nicely designed, It seems appealing to me as a user.  On few occasion, No flights available page appeared and again you have to enter details or browse through every single day on listing page.


4. Flights details: Get the details on any flight inside the data. With information on passengers, arrival and departure times, boarding passes, tickets etc. 

5. Upgrade to Value pack: A better approach in providing services on low cost without upgrading class. But when you click on to check what features are there in value pack, It just add price to your bag and sometime user is not aware of it.

6. Flight Summary: Get Flight Summary by airport. Each Airport listing will have data on arrivals and departures. Drill down into the components to get further flight information. 

7. Guest Details: Get booking information on passengers and the other flights they are listed on for any particular booking listed,


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
